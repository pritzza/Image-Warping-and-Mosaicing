# Image Processing and Mosaicing Project

This project provides tools for image processing, including point selection, image warping, rectification, and mosaicing. It consists of several Python scripts that work together to create image mosaics and perform related tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pritzza/Image-Warping-and-Mosaicing.git
   cd Image-Warping-and-Mosaicing
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scipy
   ```

## Usage

### Overview Example

First, place one or two images in the 'res' folder. For example, we'll use `cal_l.png` and `cal_r.png`.

You'll need to set the point correspondences using `point_picker.py`.

We recommend setting the correspondences simultaneously because the order of the points matters.

Open a second terminal: in one terminal, run `python point_picker.py cal_l.png`, and in the other, run `python point_picker.py cal_r.png`.

Once you're done picking points, press Enter or close the window. The points will be saved to `res/points/cal_l.points` and `res/points/cal_r.points`.

Next, you want to warp the images using `warp_img.py`.

Run the following command:

```bash
python warp_img.py cal_warped res/cal_l.png res/cal_l.points res/cal_r.png res/cal_r.points
```

This will save the warped image as `results/cal_warped.png`.

If you want to skip the warping step, you can go straight to image mosaicing using `mosaic.py`. 

To do that, run:

```bash
python mosaic.py cal_mosaic res/cal_l.png res/cal_l.points res/cal_r.png res/cal_r.points
```

Or, if you want to reuse the warped image from the previous step to save time, run:

```bash
python mosaic.py cal_mosaic res/cal_l.png res/cal_l.points res/cal_r.png res/cal_r.points res/cal_warped.png
```

This will save the mosaiced image as `results/cal_mosaic.png`.

### Point Picker

The `point_picker.py` script allows you to select corresponding points on two images.

```bash
python point_picker.py <image_filename>
```

- Click on the image to select points.
- Press Enter when finished.
- Points will be saved as `res/points/<image_filename>.points`.

### Warp Image

The `warp_img.py` script warps one image to match the perspective of another.

```bash
python warp_img.py <out_name> <img1_path> <img1_points_path> <img2_path> <img2_points_path>
```

- The warped image will be saved as `results/<out_name>.png`.

### Image Mosaicing

The `mosaic.py` script creates a mosaic from two images.

```bash
python mosaic.py <out_name> <img1_path> <img1_points_path> <img2_path> <img2_points_path> [<warped_img1_path>]
```

- If `warped_img1_path` is provided, it will use the pre-warped image instead of computing it.
- The mosaiced image will be saved as `results/<out_name>.png`.

### Image Rectification

The `rectify.py` script rectifies an image based on selected points.

```bash
python rectify.py <out_name> <img_path> <img_points_path> <width> <height>
```

- The rectified image will be saved as `results/<out_name>.png`.
